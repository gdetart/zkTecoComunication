# Communication sdk for Zk c3 series

This is one of the best access hardware I have worked with.

It has built in sql database and a great way to manage data and access.
This works with c3 series 
Make sure that you have the .dll files in the sys32 and 64 or it will throw errors.
In case you need Dll-s please contact me so I can provide them
